# freeclimb.Model.OutDialConnectWebhook

A Call generated by OutDial has connected and the callConnectUrl is being invoked. This request is made in the context of the Call leg that was generated using OutDial and not the parent (the OutDialStart webhook is invoked on the parent call to continue that call context). A PerCL response is expected if the call was successfully connected (as indicated by status of inProgress) and begins the execution context for this (child) call.
