# freeclimb.Model.PlayEarlyMedia
`PlayEarlyMedia` is relevant only when present as the very first command in the PerCL script returned for an incoming Call. In such cases, the command is executed before FreeClimb attempts to connect the call. The audio file it uses can be stored in any location that is accessible via URL.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Command** | **string** | Name of PerCL Command (this is automatically derived from mapping configuration and should not be manually supplied in any arguments) | [optional] 
**File** | **string** | RL of the audio file to be played to the caller. The URL can be the &#x60;recordingUrl&#x60; generated from the &#x60;RecordUtterance&#x60; or &#x60;StartRecordCall&#x60; PerCL commands or any accessible URL. FreeClimb will respect Cache-Control headers for this file. Use these to limit repeated requests for unchanged audio. If no Cache-Control header is provided, the file will be cached for seven days by default. |
