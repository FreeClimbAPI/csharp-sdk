  description: "FreeClimb is a cloud-based application programming interface (API)\
    \ that puts the power of the Vail platform in your hands. FreeClimb simplifies\
    \ the process of creating applications that can use a full range of telephony\
    \ features without requiring specialized or on-site telephony equipment. Using\
    \ the FreeClimb REST API to write applications is easy! You have the option to\
    \ use the language of your choice or hit the API directly. Your application can\
    \ execute a command by issuing a RESTful request to the FreeClimb API. The base\
    \ URL to send HTTP requests to the FreeClimb REST API is: /apiserver. FreeClimb\
    \ authenticates and processes your request."
